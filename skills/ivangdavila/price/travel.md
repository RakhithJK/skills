# Travel & Hospitality

## Flight Price Timing

- **Domestic booking window** — Best prices typically 3-6 weeks before departure
- **International booking window** — Best prices typically 2-4 months out
- **Day of week patterns** — Tuesdays/Wednesdays often cheapest to fly, weekends premium
- **Time of day to book** — No consistent pattern despite myths. Prices change based on demand, not clock.

## Hidden Fee Transparency

Always calculate TRUE total:

| Fee Type | Typical Range | Where Hidden |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Baggage | $30-60 per bag | Only in checkout |
| Seat selection | $15-50 | After booking |
| Resort fees | $25-50/night | In fine print |
| Parking | $20-40/day | Not in room rate |
| Taxes | 10-20% | Added at checkout |
| Booking fees | $5-25 | OTA markup |

## Platform Price Variance

Same flight/hotel shows different prices:
- **Airline/hotel direct** — Often has best loyalty perks, price match
- **OTAs (Expedia, Booking)** — Sometimes cheaper, less flexibility
- **Aggregators (Google Flights, Kayak)** — Good for comparison, don't book there
- **Points/miles** — Calculate cents-per-point to compare fairly

## Dynamic Pricing Detection

- **Incognito doesn't help** — Airlines price by route demand, not your cookies
- **Tuesday afternoon spikes** — Some routes spike mid-week then drop
- **Event-driven surges** — Conferences, festivals, sports = 2-3x normal rates
- **Currency arbitrage** — Booking in different currency can save 5-10%

## Post-Booking Monitoring

- **Price drop refunds** — Some airlines/hotels credit difference if price drops
- **Free cancellation windows** — Rebook at lower price, cancel original
- **Credit card protections** — Some cards cover price drops automatically

## Seasonal Patterns

| Destination Type | Cheapest | Most Expensive |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| Beach resorts | Sep-Nov | Dec-Apr |
| Europe | Nov-Mar | Jun-Aug |
| Ski resorts | Oct, Apr | Dec-Mar |
| Business cities | Weekends | Weekdays |

Shoulder season savings: typically 30-50% vs peak.
