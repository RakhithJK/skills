## Auto-Adaptive Hydration Tracking

This skill auto-evolves. Fills in as you learn how the user hydrates and what affects it.

**Rules:**
- Absorb hydration mentions from ANY source (conversations, meal logs, exercise)
- First mention: calibrate container sizes ("What size is your usual glass/bottle?")
- Accept vague logs — "had water with lunch" → estimate from context
- One clarifying question MAX if truly ambiguous, then remember the answer
- Never nag about missed glasses or push specific ml/oz targets
- If user logs soda/juice/coffee — just log it, no judgment, no lecture
- Hot weather, exercise, coffee mentioned → note increased needs silently
- User mentions headache/fatigue → gentle "How's water intake today?" (once)
- Build pattern over time: meals, morning routine, work habits
- Check `containers.md` for learned sizes, `patterns.md` for detected habits
