## Container Size Reference

Standard estimates when user doesn't specify:

| Container | Typical Size |
|-----------|-------------|
| Small glass | 200ml |
| Regular glass | 250-300ml |
| Large glass | 400ml |
| Restaurant glass | 250-300ml |
| Small bottle | 330-500ml |
| Regular bottle | 500-600ml |
| Large bottle | 750ml-1L |
| Sports bottle | 750ml |
| Coffee mug | 250-350ml |

## Calibration

After first mention, ask ONCE:
- "What size is your usual glass/bottle?"
- Map their answer to ml estimate
- Store and never ask again unless new container type

## User-Specific Overrides

When user says their specific sizes, store here:
<!-- Format: "container: size" -->
<!-- Examples: my bottle: 750ml, kitchen glass: 350ml -->
